/lustre/scratch116/tol/projects/darwin/data/mammals/Cervus_elaphus/working/mito-v2.11.5.4/test_template/	on -r mode has two potential contigs (largest one has frameshifts, the other doesn't)
/lustre/scratch116/tol/projects/darwin/data/insects/Nomada_fabriciana/working/mitohifi-v2.11.5.4/template	on -r mode has only one potential contig
/lustre/scratch116/tol/projects/darwin/data/insects/Bombus_pratorum/working/mitohifi_2.11.5.3/joao_template	on -r mode has some contigs that don't have a tRNA-Phe
/lustre/scratch116/tol/projects/darwin/data/dicots/Ailanthus_altissima/working/mito	mito dataset from a plant species where the reference mitogenome is much longer than any of the contigs assembled with hifiasm
