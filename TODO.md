1. how to run mitos2, how to integrate it with the current pipeline and compare it with mitofinder annotation (runtime and annotation result)
2. if only one contig in parsed_blast.txt, look for two other contigs from parsed_blast_all.txt
3. create a file "numts.txt" that will hold contigs greater than 5 times the related mito 
	* this will likely be done by modifying the `parse_blast.py` file
4. parallelize annotation
5. replace Mitofinder by Mitos
